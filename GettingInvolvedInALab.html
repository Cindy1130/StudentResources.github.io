    <p class="w3-justify">
	Research an institution – whether it be universities, 
	hospitals, or government institutions – near where you live that conducts 
	your research of interest is a good start. The best way to inquire about 
	research opportunities is by email. The email address of the person who is 
	responsible are usually stated on the institution’s webpage. Sometimes, 
	professors at universities will reject or not respond to your request, thus, 
	it is recommended that your email multiple professors. In you email, include your name,
	current school, previous experience/science background, reason for seeking this research 
	opportunity, research interest, and résumé. In your email, you can write about a recent 
	scientific paper that the professor published to express your interest and increase your 
	chances of being offered a research opportunity!

	<p class="w3-justify">
	  If you know friends, family, or former graduates at your school who have worked in a lab or local universities, 
	  they can be a valuable source of information for research opportunities. In addition, Guidance Counsellors might 
	  be able to provide advice based on the experience of former students who have acquired such opportunities.
