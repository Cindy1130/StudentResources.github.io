<h2><a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a></h2>
<h3>"Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning 
dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. 
We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. 
Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, 
adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with 
institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and 
MIT to offer specialized content."</h3>
 
<h2><a href = "http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/">Learn.Genetics</a></h2>
<h3>A comprehensive website that covers topics including genetics, human health, cell biology,
neuroscience, ecology, and science tools used in biology. There are a variety of virtual labs,
simulations, and videos for a better understanding.</h3>

<h2><a href = "https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/category/new">Phet Interactive Simulations</a></h2>
<h3>"PhET is a suite of research-based interactive computer simulations for teaching and learning
 physics, chemistry, math, and other sciences. PhET simulations can be run online or downloaded 
 for free from the PhET website. The simulations are animated, interactive, and game-like environments 
 where students learn through exploration. They emphasize the connections between real-life phenomena 
 and the underlying science, and help make the visual and conceptual models of expert scientists 
 accessible to students. PhET simulations are primarily developed for and tested with university 
 and high school students, but have been found to be educational and fun for students "from grade 
 school to grad school."</h3>
